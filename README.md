## baru

My own bar for [spectrwm](https://github.com/conformal/spectrwm), coded in Rust (and a little bit of C).

![baru](https://github.com/doums/baru/tree/master/public/baru.png)

### features

* date and time
* battery (level, status, design level based)
* wireless (state, essid, signal strength)
* wired (state)
* audio sink and source (level, muted)
* brightness
* cpu usage and temperature
* memory (percent or used/total in gigaoctet)
* dynamic icons, colors
* configuration in YAML

All the info is read direclty from the kernel files (`/sys`, `/proc`). Except audio and network modules which use libraries.\
Some modules run in their own thread.
Thanks to this design (as well Rust and C), baru is lightweight and efficient. It can run at a refresh rate of 60 "fps" with a minimal processor footprint.

The audio module communicates with the [PulseAudio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/) server through the [client API](https://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/doxygen/) to retrieve its data.\
Wireless and wired modules use the netlink interface with the help of [libnl](https://www.infradead.org/~tgr/libnl/) to talk directly to kernel and retrieve their data.\
In addition, wireless module uses the [802.11](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/linux/nl80211.h) API.

Baru is modular. This means that only the modules you want to see are instantiated and executed.

### prerequisite

- libnl (for wired and wireless modules)
- pulseaudio (for sound and mic modules)
- an icon font installed (I use [this](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-Font))

### configuration

The binary looks for the config file `baru.yaml` located in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/baru/` (default to `$HOME/.config/baru/`).\
If the config file is not found, baru prints an error and exits.\
All options are detailed [here](https://github.com/doums/baru/blob/master/baru.yaml).

Example:
```yaml
bar: '%c  %t  %b  %s   %w %a   %d'
tick: 50
default_font: +@fn=0;
icon_font: +@fn=1;
default_color: +@fg=0;
red: +@fg=1;
green: +@fg=2;
mic:
  index: 1
wireless:
  interface: wlp2s0
  display: Essid
  max_essid_len: 4
temperature:
  core_inputs: 2..5
```
